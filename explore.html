        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my academic journey at St. Clair County Community College (SC4) in Port Huron, Michigan, where I earned an Associate of Science degree. This foundational education paved the way for my transfer to Wayne State University, where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Currently, I am furthering my studies at Wayne State University by pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Science.

            My academic interests have evolved over time, leading me to develop a strong passion for data analysis. As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in this field, I am dedicated to building a career in data science. I am enthusiastic about leveraging data to drive insights and make informed decisions, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead in this dynamic and ever-growing field.</p>
